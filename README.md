# Nanopore_IV_Analysis
Automates conductance and rectification calculations from individal IV traces (excel)
Python programme: use Anaconda Navigator
Ensure data file is excel format and is in same folder as the code files
Ensure data file is in array form with headings of voltage, p1_1234, p2_1567... (where numbers indicate test time) *only if want to monitor times since pore fabrication
Input informaion on RunIV using Jupyter Notebook
